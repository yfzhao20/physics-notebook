## Polarization state 

### How to describe p-state 

we use $\boldsymbol{E}=\boldsymbol{E_0}e^{i(kz-wt)}$ to describe the state of the light. Usually, we choose a certain location. It is doesn't matter, however the easiest one is z=0. So we let z=0 and ==$\boldsymbol{E}=\boldsymbol{E_0}e^{-iwt}$==. However $\boldsymbol{E}$ can still change when time changes. So **how $\boldsymbol{E_0}e^{iwt}$ changes with time** is called ==**polarization state**==. <img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-21-08-37-29.png" style="zoom:30%;" />

So we can choose horizontal base $\hat{\boldsymbol{H}}$ and vertical base $\hat{\boldsymbol{V}}$. However there is a question: suppose that light comes towards you and you see it is right-hand, but if looking in the other way, it is left-hand. So we ==keep $\bold{k}$ towards you==. 

And now we have the vector $\boldsymbol{E_0}$, and $\boldsymbol{E_0}=E_H \boldsymbol{\hat{H}}+E_V\boldsymbol{ \hat{V}}$. If the component of $\boldsymbol{E}$ is real, we can let:

$$
E_H=A\\
E_V=B
$$

and then the whole vector was determined. And $\boldsymbol{E}$ can only oscillate along the diraction. However the two component may have a phase relation, such as, $\boldsymbol{E}$ can rotate. So $E_H, E_V$ should be complex: 

$$
E_H=Ae^{i\phi_H}\\
E_V=Be^{i\phi _V}
$$

Fix $A,B,\phi _H,\phi _V$, and the polarization state can be fixed. However actually the relative phase matters. And we can write $\boldsymbol{E}$ as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \boldsymbol{E}=&Ae^{i\phi _H}\boldsymbol{\hat{H}}+Be^{i\phi _V}\boldsymbol{\hat{V}}e^{-iwt}\\
    =&e^{i\phi _H}(A \hat{\boldsymbol{H}}+Be^{i\phi}\boldsymbol{\hat{V}})e^{-iwt}\\
    &\small(\phi =\phi _V-\phi _H)
\end{aligned}
$$

why writing the vec that way is because we will write it in a column vec, called ==**Jone's vec**==:

$$
\boldsymbol{E_0}=\begin{bmatrix}
     A \\
     Be^{i\phi } \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
where:
	$A$: amplitude of H component.
	$B$: amplitude of V component. $A,B>0$.
	$\phi=\phi _V-\phi _H$: phase diff between vertical and horizontal oscillation.

Now we can treat polarization as two orthogonal oscillators. Choose diff $A,B$ and $\phi $ and you can determine polarization states. <img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-21-14-24-57.png" style="zoom:35%;" />

### Different p-states

#### Linear polarized light

==$\phi =0 \text{ or }\phi =\pi$.== Analysis:

- $\phi =0, \boldsymbol{E}=\begin{bmatrix}A \\B \\\end{bmatrix}e^{-iwt}$ . Take the real part: $\begin{cases}E_H=A\cos wt\\E_V=B\cos wt\\\tan\theta =\frac{B}{A}\end{cases}$.<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-21-14-25-35.png" style="zoom:35%;" />

- $\phi =\pi ,\boldsymbol{E}=\begin{bmatrix}A \\-B \\\end{bmatrix}e^{-iwt}$. Similarly.

#### Circular polarized light 
<div class="note">How to define lead or lag physically?</div>

==$A=B,\phi =\mp \frac{\pi }{2}$==. Analysis:

- $\phi =-\frac{\pi }{2}, \boldsymbol{E}=A\begin{bmatrix}
     1 \\
     e^{-i \frac{\pi }{2}} \\
    \end{bmatrix}e^{-iwt}$. 
    The real part is $\begin{cases}
    E_H=A\cos wt\\
    E_V=A\cos (wt+\frac{\pi}{2})
    \end{cases}$ 
    If $t=\Delta t>0$,$E_H$ will go down from A, and $E_V$ will go minus from 0.<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-21-16-19-08.png" style="zoom:35%;" />
    That means it is  **C.W** rotation, or **<u>right-circular polarized light</u>**(R,$\circlearrowright$).

Now we consider which component is leading in phase, or goes ahead. Remember that $\phi \in(-\pi ,\pi )$. And if $\phi >0$, $E_V$ is **lagging** . If $\phi <0$, $E_V$ is **leading**. So when $\phi =\frac{-\pi }{2}$, $E_V$ leads $E_H$, and you get R light.

- $\phi= \frac{\pi}{2}, \boldsymbol{E}=A\begin{bmatrix}
     1 \\
     e^{i \frac{\pi }{2}} \\
     \end{bmatrix}e^{-iwt}$. 
     <img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-21-16-42-51.png" style="zoom:35%;" />That means $\boldsymbol{E}$ goes C.C.W, and you will get **<u>left-circular polarized light</u>**(L, $\circlearrowleft$)

#### Elliptical polarized light

if putting any $A,B,\phi $ in it, you will get elliptical P-light.

==Any $A,B,\phi $ except those above==.

$\boldsymbol{E}=\begin{bmatrix}
      A \\
      Be^{i\phi } \\
\end{bmatrix}$, and the real part is : $\begin{cases}
    E_H=A\cos(wt)\\
    E_V=B\cos(wt-\phi )
\end{cases}$. We can draw the picture just like before.

$\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 1}}$ $\boldsymbol{E_0}=\begin{bmatrix}
      2 \\
      e^{i(-\frac{2}{3}\pi )} \\
\end{bmatrix}$<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-21-20-09-20.png" style="zoom:35%;" />

We can define the amplitude and draw a $2\times 1$ box. From $\phi =-\frac{2}{3}\pi$, we know how it rotates($\circlearrowright$,because $\phi <0$ and $E_V$ is leading) and the long-axis diraction($\searrow$, because $|\phi |>\frac{\pi}{2}$). Also you can know $\theta$ in the figure, <u>but you should prove in your hw. </u>

So the take-home message is: 

- $A,B,\phi$ completely define p-state
- specific condition: linear of circular p-lignt
- more general: elliptical
- Jone's vector(and later we will write $\boldsymbol{E}$ as $|E\rang$)

#### Unpolarized light

Those $A,B,\phi$ above are all fixed, that means the phase and amplitude don not change. That is called p-state, or **pure state**. <img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-21-20-40-41.png" style="zoom:45%;" />
In real life, the light is actually not polarized light. So that is the question: how to prepare pure polarized light. Before that, we will talk about unpolarized light(or mixed state in quantum).

As the figure shows, every diraction is possible and there is no phas relations bet two directions. If it is completely random, it is called natural light. It is not easy to express in math, maybe using density matrix. Here we try to use the vector. <img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-21-20-52-40.png" style="zoom:35%;" />

Suppose horizontal and vertical component has equal amount. That means :

$$
\boldsymbol{E}=A \hat{\boldsymbol{H}}+Ae^{i\Delta} \boldsymbol{\hat{V}},\qquad\small\Delta \text{ is random}
$$
That means $\Delta$ can jump. And when you take average, that term just gone. <img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-21-21-17-09.png" style="zoom:30%;" />

#### Partial polarized

That is the more general case. Even there is no relationship bet diff direction, some wavetrains are more likely to oscillate along a specific direction. In the graph, vertical direction is more likely than horizontal direction:

$$
\boldsymbol{E}=A \hat{\boldsymbol{H}}+Be^{i\Delta} \hat{\boldsymbol{V}}, \quad B>A, \Delta\text{ is random}
$$

why say it is partial polarized? Because it can be treated as a certain linear p-light plus natural light.

### Dirac notation

Now we have a new exp: **Dirac notation.** Here is a **Dirac ket** ==$|E\rang$==:

$$
\boldsymbol{E}\rightarrow|E\rang= \begin{bmatrix}
     A \\
     Be^{i\phi } \\
\end{bmatrix}_{(H-V)}
$$

Of course this exp is under H-V base, and needless to always say where it is. Here H-V is default base. 

And we know:

$$
|\boldsymbol{E}|^2=\boldsymbol{E}^*\cdot \boldsymbol{E}=A^2+B^2(\propto I)
$$

How to express that? In linear algebra we use transpose and complex conjugation (because $\boldsymbol{E}$ is complex) to exp that. In dirac notation, it is a **Dirac bra** vector ==$\lang E|$==:

$$
\boldsymbol{E}^*\overset{\text{adjoint}}{\longrightarrow}|E\rang^\dagger\rightarrow\lang E|=\begin{bmatrix}
    A &  Be^{-i\phi } \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

So you can write the module as:

$$
\begin{matrix}
    |\boldsymbol{E}|^2= &  \lang E|E\rang&= A^2+B^2 \\
         &  \text{bra c ket}& \\
\end{matrix}
$$

and

$$
\boldsymbol{B}^*\cdot \boldsymbol{A}=\sum b_i^*a_i=\lang B|A\rang
$$

There is something you need to pay attention to:

1. **The order of Dirac notation matters.**
    If you write $\lang A|B\rang$, it will give you a number. And if you write $|A\rang\lang B|$,it will give you a matrix. 
    So it is "bra ket", not "ket bra"(which we call projector).

2. **Taking conjugate** (conjugate in physics=conjugate and transpose) **is switch**.
   That means: **bra→ket; ket→bra. And changer order.**
   $\color{green}{\bf{▶ Pf.}}$ $\lang A|B\rang=\boldsymbol{A}^*\cdot \boldsymbol{B}=\sum a_i^*b_i=(\sum b_i^*a_i)^*=(\boldsymbol{B}^*\cdot \boldsymbol{A})^*=(\lang B|A\rang)^\dagger$
    or you can derive from: $(\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{B})^\dagger=\boldsymbol{B}^\dagger \boldsymbol{A}^\dagger$, so $(\lang B|A\rang)^\dagger=|A\rang^\dagger\lang B|^\dagger=\lang A|B\rang$
    $\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. }}$ $(\lang A|B\rang|B\rang)^\dagger=\lang B|\lang A|B\rang$

**==Practice==**: Base vectors in polarization.

<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-23-11-43-36.png" style="zoom:30%;" />basically we have **horizotally polarized E field $|H\rang$** and **vertical $|V\rang$**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    |H\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
     1 \\
     0 \\
\end{bmatrix}\\
|V\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
     0 \\
     1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-23-11-46-52.png" style="zoom:30%;" />but we can choose other bases, for example: **linear polarization base $|+45\rang$ and $|-45\rang$**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    |+45\rang&=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
     1 \\
     1 \\
\end{bmatrix}\\
|-45\rang&=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
     -1 \\
     1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

or **circular polarization base $|R\rang$ and $|L\rang$** :<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-23-11-51-53.png" style="zoom:30%;" />

$$
\begin{aligned}
    |R\rang&=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
         1 \\
         -i \\
    \end{bmatrix}\\
    |L\rang&=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
         1 \\
         i \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-23-11-54-16.png" style="zoom:30%;" />or...how abour this?

$$
\begin{aligned}
    |1\rang&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\begin{bmatrix}
         2 \\
         i \\
    \end{bmatrix}\\
    |2\rang&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\begin{bmatrix}
         1 \\
         -2i \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

this is also a orthogonal base, because: 

$$
\lang 1|2\rang \propto\begin{bmatrix}
     2 &  -i \\
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
      1 \\
      -2i \\
\end{bmatrix}=0
$$

Of course all the vec above is in terms of (H-V) base. But you can choose all base above. Those are all orthonormal base. 

Sometimes the (H-V) base is not the best choice. For exp, we want to know, for the same $|E\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
      A \\
      Be^{i\phi } \\
\end{bmatrix}$, how much of the light is the circular p-light. That means: $|E\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
      ? \\
      ? \\
\end{bmatrix}_{(L-R)}$. So we should do the projection. Just dot $|E\rang$ with the base and you will get it:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \lang R|E\rang&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
         1 &  i \\
    \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
          A \\
          Be^{i\phi } \\
    \end{bmatrix}=E_R\\
     \lang L|E\rang&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
          1 &  -i \\
     \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
           A \\
           Be^{i\phi } \\
     \end{bmatrix}=E_L\\
     E_{R-L}&=\begin{bmatrix}
           E_R \\
           E_L \\
     \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
           \lang R| \\
           \lang L| \\
     \end{bmatrix}|E\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
          |R\rang &  |L\rang \\
     \end{bmatrix}^\dagger |E\rang\\
     |E\rang&=|R\rang E_R+|L\rang E_L=\begin{bmatrix}
          |R\rang & |L\rang \\
     \end{bmatrix}E_{R-L}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Preparation of  polarization state

<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-23-14-50-01.png" style="zoom:30%;" />Now we have natural light. We firstly need to prepare polarized light. That is the initial condition, and we will do it similarly in quantum. 

That is easy by using **linear polarizer**. Light can only pass along a specific direction and another direction will be absorbed. Or you can use **Brewster angle**, that means using reflection. You incident the light in the specific angle, and the output will be polarized. And later we will use **birefringence crystal**.

### Malus law

<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-23-15-13-47.png" style="zoom:30%;" />Suppose you have a linear p-light. How will you test it? You can put another polarizer and check the output. If the angle bet A and T-axis is $\theta$, then:

$$
I=I_0\cos^2\theta 
$$

That is called **Malus law**. It is a natural idea, because $A\cos\theta$ pass and $A \sin\theta$ is blocked. So if you rotate the polarizer, you will find intensity changes, from 0 ($\theta =\frac{\pi}{2}$) to $I_0$($\theta =0$).<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-23-15-23-49.png" style="zoom:20%;" />

In the figure, the first polarizer is called polarizer, and the second is called detector. It is easy to produce and detect linear p-light. 

- **circular p-light and natural light**

And how about **circular p-light** passing the linear polarizer? Just consider its H and V component:

<div class=note>
polarizer: 起偏器 <br>
detector : 检偏器 
</div>

$$
\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \begin{aligned}
A\begin{bmatrix}
      1 \\
      i \\
\end{bmatrix}&\longrightarrow A\begin{bmatrix}
      1 \\
      0 \\
\end{bmatrix}\\
\sqrt{2}A&\longrightarrow A
\end{aligned}
$$

So you can see that

$$
I_{out}=A^2=\frac{1}{2}I_{in}
$$

And how about **natural light**? You can do the similar thing:

<div class=note>
It is such a good work that you even don't need to do integration.
</div>

$$
\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad A\begin{bmatrix}
      1 \\
      e^{i\Delta} \\
\end{bmatrix}\longrightarrow A\begin{bmatrix}
     1  \\
     0  \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

So you will also get:

$$
I_{out}=\frac{1}{2}I_{in}
$$

So you can not tell the diff bet circular p-light and natural light, even if you rotate your polarizer. So the linear polarizer can only detect linear p-light. 

- **elliptical p-light and partial p-light**

For elliptical p-lignt and partial p-lignt? That is the general condition:

$$
|E\rang_{in}=\begin{bmatrix}
      A \\
      Be^{i\phi } \\
\end{bmatrix}  
$$

<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-23-15-50-30.png" style="zoom:30%;" />you put the T-axis at $\theta$ position, and do the calculation. Just let H and V component **be projected to** T-axis:

$$
E_T=A\cos\theta +Be^{i\phi }\sin\theta 
$$

remember they are all complex number and have a phase diff. So

$$
I_T=|E_T|^2=A^2\cos^2\theta +B^2\sin^2\theta +2AB\cos\theta \sin\theta \cos\phi 
$$

and it dep on $\phi$. Change $\theta$ and $I_T$ will change. And the long-axis direction is the biggest $I_T$ direction. 

### Prepare any p-state

<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-23-19-48-52.png" style="zoom:30%;" />Now we have linear p-light. What we want is to prepare any p-state $\begin{bmatrix}
      A \\
      Be^{i\phi } \\
\end{bmatrix}$. We should fix $A,B$ and $\phi$. 

A theoretical method is, give me horizontal p-light, and vertical p-light, and then add them up with stable phase diff. You can use **PBS** and interferometer. Light incident PBS (polarization beam spliter) by **Brewster angle** with the thin film. One beam get vertical-polarized, and the other get horizontal-polarized. We do have this device. <img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-23-19-55-06.png" style="zoom:30%;" />

And then we can get p p-light(parallel) and s p-light(perpendicular, German). Use mirrors to get them meet and put another PBS tho combine them. Now we successfully make one overlap the other. Just adjust the mirror and you can change $\phi$. 

This is too complex because you should adjust the mirrors accurately. But it give me some ideas. That is, make OPL diff $\Delta L$ to change $\phi =k\Delta L$.

### Linear birefringence in the crystal

<div class="note">
anisotropic: 各向异性
</div>


<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-23-20-17-08.png" style="zoom:25%;" />Using **birefringence crystal** is a better way to prepare p-light. Here we just talk about **linear birefringence** (there is also **circular birefringence**, called optical activity). 

It is related with light propagating in crystal. That is because crystal is anisotropic. Crystal has some particular inside structure.<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-23-20-41-45.png" style="zoom:30%;" />

If you shine in the light normally, you can find the light splits into two beam. One of that goes normally and follows geometric path, called $o$ light(ordinary). And the other beam will goes at a certain angle, which disobeys Snell's law. That beam is called $e$ light(extraordinary). 

It is easy to understand in physics (not in math, which is complex). If the polarization is **along** the dipole, it can make the molecule oscillate, which means give it some energy. That is strong interaction. And it appears the velocity of light decreases and media has index. When they are **perpendicular**, the inter is very weak(almost can be neglect). <img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-23-21-03-12.png" style="zoom:25%;" />

Strong interaction means big index. If there is no inter, index =1 and v has no change.

In isotropic media, the direction of molecules is random. There is equal number of molucules of all the direction. So averagely, the inter of all direction of p-light is same.

However in anisotropic media, it will change. Let's "crystalize" it.  You just put all the dipoles along the direction (showing in the figure). Then you can find $n_p$ can change with $\theta$. But $n_s$ doesn't change. So here s light is $o$ light (just here, not all condition)

#### Which polarization is o,e?

<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-26-16-10-47.png" style="zoom:25%;" />We can see that there is a specific direction(green direction in the figure) in the crystal, along which $o$-light and $e$-light has no diff, or $n_e=n_o$. That special direction is called ==optical axis(O.A.)==. Not all crystal has optical axis, but we don't care that. Optical axis is just a direction, so you can draw many lines in the crystal(shown in the figure). 


Now let the light shine in the crystal. Usually $\boldsymbol{k}$ and O.A. can form a plain, called principal plain. It is easy to find that $o$-light is perpendicular to principal plain and $e$-light is in the plain. 

 <div class=note>
      principal plain: 主平面
 </div>

Next, we will talk about the index. 

####  index ($n$) for the $o$ and $e$ light

<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-26-16-30-46.png" style="zoom:25%;" />$o$-light travels isotropically as we showed above, but how about $e$-light? We talk about the velocity of them. For $o$-light, velocity is same along all direction (we put O.A.  along horizental direction), equals $v_0$. So we can define:
$$
     n_0=\frac{c}{v_0}
$$

However, for $e$-light, $v=v_0$ along O.A.. But for other direction, it changes. $v$ changes biggest at $\theta =\frac{\pi}{2}$, and in the other direction, $v(\theta )<v_0$. Actually, there is the relation bet $n(\theta )$ fot $e$-light:(derivation is in *Zhao*'s book):

$$
     \frac{1}{n(\theta )}=\frac{\cos^2\theta}{n_0^2}+\frac{\sin^2\theta }{n_e^2}
$$

Where

$$
     n_0=\frac{c}{v_0}\\
     n_e=\frac{c}{v_e}
$$

And define:
$n_e>n_0$: positive (+) crystal
$n_e<n_0$: negative (-) crystal
(of course the example we gave above is a positive crystal.)

#### Examples of light propagating in the crystal

$\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 1}}$ $\boldsymbol{k}$ along O.A.<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-26-16-39-48.png" style="zoom:25%;" />

There is no distinction bet $o$-light and $e$-light. And when it goes out, nothing has changed.

$\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 2}}$ $\boldsymbol{k}$ perpendicular to O.A. (★)

<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-26-16-57-24.png" style="zoom:25%;" />Now we rotate the same crystal 90 degree. We can find p-light becomes $e$-light and s-light becomes $o$-light. And now $n=n_e$ because $\theta =90^\circ$. We use this case to make waveplate and do the experiment. 

Suppose it is a positive crystal and $n_e>n_0$. We can find that $n_p>n_s$, or $v_s>v_p$. So after the light pass through the crystal, there is a phase diff bet the polarized light

$$
\Delta\phi _{eo} =k_0(n_e-n_0)d_0
$$

Now we can change the phase diff by changing $n_e,n_0$ and d. This is much easier. <img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-26-17-12-57.png" style="zoom:25%;" />

$\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 3}}$ light shine in at $\theta $ and $\boldsymbol{k}$ is perpendicular to O.A.

It goes into two beams. Here $n_e>n_0$, so it is positive crystal. Easy to get from snell's law:

$$
     n\sin\theta_i=n_0\sin\theta_0=n_e\sin\theta _e
$$


## Optical elements manipulate the p-state

### Linear polarizer(from $\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 3}}$ above)

You can find that $\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 3}}$  separate p-light and s-light. Here we give an example of the device: **Wollaston**. It is arranged like this( shown in the figure). The O.A.  of the two parts are perpendicular. When the light shine in from leftside, it finally got separated(principle shown in the figure). 

<center><img src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-27-14-50-49.png" style="zoom:35%;" /></center>

In the left part, *p* is $e$-light and *s* is $o$-light. But *p* and *s* are not separated. However, when they pass interface, they will be separated. *p* will change into $o$-light and $n_p$ get smaller ($n_e\rightarrow n_0=n_p$), but *s* will change into $e$-light and $n_s$ get bigger ($n_0\rightarrow n_e=n_s$). According to Snell's law:

$$
     n_e \sin\theta_i=n_0\sin\theta_p\\
     n_0\sin\theta_i=n_e\sin\theta_s
$$

And easy to get 

$$
     \theta _p\ge \theta_i\\
     \theta _s\le \theta_i
$$

(Disadvantage is: too expensive 😂).

### Wave-plate ($\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 2}}$ above)

#### Quarter ($\frac{\lambda}{4}$) wave-plate (Q)

It means $(n_e-n_0)d=\frac{\lambda}{4}+m\lambda$. We don't need to let the thickness of Q be $\frac{\lambda}{4}$, because $m\lambda$ doesn't matter ($+2m\pi$). <img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-28-08-56-28.png" style="zoom:30%;" />

Q can change p-state. It can make:

$$
     \delta_{eo}=\pm\frac{\pi}{2}+2m\pi 
$$

$\pm$ is because we haven't point out the crystal is positive or negative. If we use positive, it is $+\frac{\pi}{2}$. And negative crystal leads to $-\frac{\pi}{2}$. 

However, what is the meaning of $\delta_{eo}=\frac{\pi}{2}$ in positive crystal? That means $e$-light **lags** $o$-light by $\frac{\pi}{2}$. That is because $n_e>n_0$, which shows $v_e<v_o$ and $o$-light travels faster. Ususally we call o-direction **fast axis** in this case. In negative crystal, e-direction is fast axis. 

Summary:
$\quad\frac{\pi}{2}$: $e$ lags $o$ by $\frac{\pi}{2}$;
$-\frac{\pi}{2}$: $e$ leads $o$ by $\frac{\pi}{2}$

> **Why $o$-light leads $e$-light in that case?** We should talk about its definition:
> Let phase $\phi=kz-\omega t+\phi_0=kz-\omega(t+t_0)$. Usually we consider $z=0$ and the same $t$, and let $\phi=-\omega t_0\in [-\pi,\pi]$. And I think that $-\omega$ determines that. Here angular freq is $-\omega$ and if $\omega t=-\phi_0$ bigger, the phase will lead. 
> **There is a big problem!!!!! I haven't understand that!**

Actually, in real application, we ususally don't care which direcion is $o$ or e. We just care which is the fast axis. 

Now, let's talk about how it changes the p-state.

#### Analysis of Q-plate

Let

$$
     |E_{in}\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
           A \quad\\
           Be^{i\phi_{oe}} \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

Here we let e-direction become $|H\rang$ and o-direction become $|V\rang$. And $\phi_{oe}=\phi_o-\phi_e$ initially. 

How about the output? Wave-plate can give a phase diff bet $o$ and $e$. We can get:

$$
     |E_{out}\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
           A \\
           Be^{i(\phi_{oe}-\delta_{eo})} \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

So you only need to + or - $\frac{\pi}{2}$. Here $\delta_{eo}=\frac{\pi}{2}$ and it is a (+) crystal.

Here we give an example:

$\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 1}}$  

$$
     |E_{in}\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
      1 \\
      1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

This is linear polarized light. After it passing Q-plate, the output is:

$$
     |E_{out}\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           e^{i(-\frac{\pi}{2})} \\
     \end{bmatrix}=|R\rang
$$

Obviously it is R-circular light. And there is another way to think about it: 
Initially $\phi_{oe}=0$ and there is no phase diff. After light pass through Q-plate, $o$ leads $e$ by $\frac{\pi}{2}$, and that is right-circular. 

<center><img src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-28-09-44-56.png" style="zoom:30%;" /></center>

$\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 2}}$  let $|R\rang$ become $|E_{in}\rang$. That means $o$ leads $e$ by $\frac{\pi}{2}$. After it pass Q-plate, $o$ will leads by $\pi$, and the output will be linear:

$$
     \begin{aligned}
     |E_{in}\rang&=|R\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           e^{-i\frac{\pi}{2}} \\
     \end{bmatrix}\\
     |E_{out}\rang &=\begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           -1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}=|-45\rang
     \end{aligned}
$$

<center><img src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-28-10-40-34.png" style="zoom:28%;" /></center><img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-28-14-51-28.png" style="zoom:14%;" />

$\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 3}}$ strange input:

$$
     |E_{in}\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
           2 \\
           e^{-i \frac{5}{6}\pi} \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

$\color{green}{\bf{▶ S.}}$ output is:<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-28-14-35-25.png" style="zoom:22%;" />

$$
     |E_{out}\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
           2 \\
           e^{-i(\frac{5}{6}\pi-\frac{\pi}{2})} \\
     \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
           2 \\
           e^{-i \frac{4}{3}\pi} \\
     \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
           2 \\
           e^{i \frac{2}{3}\pi} \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

It is L-circular.

$\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 4}}$ special elliptical p-light: long-short overlap with $o$ and $e$. Easy to know that the output is linear polarized light.

<center>
    <img  src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-28-14-57-06.png" style="zoom:45%;" />
</center>

$\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 5}}$ Now we have natural light and we can use a linear-polarizer to create linear p-light. And then let it come across Q-plate. We just tell which direction is fast axis and here $o$ is fast axis. Take the coordinate like the figure($45^\circ$). Of course we can get $R$ light. 

Now that is the question: after reflected by the mirror, what is its p-state?

Remember you always look into direction of the light! And now you should set another coordinate: $\boldsymbol{k}'=-\boldsymbol{k}$.

So easy to imagine that it will become $L$ light. The direction of rotation doesn't change, but your point of view changes.
<center>
<img  src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-28-15-41-02.png" style="zoom:45%;" /></center>

Now let it pass Q-plate again. Be careful! Because direction of $e$ also changes! It is now $\boldsymbol{e}' =-\boldsymbol{e}$. For $L$ light, $o$ lags $e$ in $\frac{\pi}{2}$. After passing Q-plate, phase diff will change into 0 and it will become linear. 

However, always remember that the direction of axis has changed. So the direction of oscillation has **rotated $\bf90^\circ$** from initial polarized light. 

---

So now, **by inserting polarizer and waveplate and adjusting the angle, we can create all kinds of p-light.**

#### Half-walf plate($\frac{\lambda}{2}$ plate; H)

H-plate means $\delta_{eo}=(n_e-n_0)d =\frac{\lambda}{2}$. Its phase diff is $\pm \pi$. Of course they are same. For input light:<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-28-15-51-46.png" style="zoom:35%;" /> 

$$
     |in\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
           A \\
           Be^{i\phi_{oe}} \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

The output will be:

$$
     |out\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
           A \\
           Be^{i(\phi_{oe}+\pi)} \\     
     \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
           A \\
           -Be^{i\phi_{oe}} \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

So just flip $o$ (actually $V$) direction. 

The take-home message is, H plate doesn't change p-state, just changes the direction.

### Create any desired p-state

<center><img src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-28-15-59-17.png" style="zoom:40%;" /></center>

Now we can create any p-state conveniently. Here we arbitrarily draw a p-stete. Consider a more general condition, that is initially, we have natural light. 

**Step.1** create pure state, i.e.  linear p-state. 

**Step.2** let it pass a Q-plate. Put fast axis at the spectific direction, and you will get a similar ellipse to the target. 

**Step.3** put a H-plate bet your ellipse and target, and then your p-state will overlap on the target p-state. Bingo!

<center><img  src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-28-16-17-28.png" style="zoom:35%;" /></center>

### Test any input p-state

It is easy to test linear p-state. You can just use linear polarizer. But you can not tell the diff bet natural and circular, or elliptical and partial. However, if you have Q-plate, you can distinguish them. 

Now we give an example.

$\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 1}}$ distinguish elliptical and partial p-light. 

Firstly you can use linear polarizer and rotate it. From that you can detect the max and min axis of the elliptical (or the partial). 
And then, you can put fast axis of Q-plate along max axis. If it is partial, the output is still partial because you can not change randomness. However, if it is elliptical, it will change into linear! Then you can use a linear polarizer to detect them, and there will be a direction where there is no light. From this, you can distinguish them.

After that, you can prepare and detect all kinds of p-state.

## Matrix expression of states(polarization) and optical elements

At the beginning, we talk about p-state. Later it will become quantum state, for exp, spin state. 

- Expression of state

What is the expression of states? Now we have an input:

$$
     |E_{in}\rang=\begin{bmatrix}
           A \\
           Be^{i\phi} \\
     \end{bmatrix}_{H-V}=A|H\rang+Be^{i\phi}|V\rang
$$

Here we should say, we can express $|E_{in}\rang$ in matrix exp because we point out the base, $H-V$. Without that, we can only write $|E_{in}\rang$.

And its complex conjugate:

$$
     \lang E_{in}|=\begin{bmatrix}
           A \\
           Be^{-i\phi} \\
     \end{bmatrix}=(|E_{in}\rang)^\dagger
$$

$$
     \lang E_{in}|E_{in}\rang=|\boldsymbol{E}|^2=A^2+B^2    
$$

- Expression of optical elements that changes state

An optical element can change state. Generally speaking, it is a matrix:

$$
     \widetilde{O}|E_{in}\rang=|E_{out}\rang
$$

$\widetilde{O}$ is **Operator**, which represents action by optical elements. 

### Find matrix of Opreator (matrix form in certain base)

Here we start from a simple exp: reflection. We want to know:<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-30-15-27-19.png" style="zoom:25%;" />

$$
     \begin{bmatrix}
           E_{pr} \\
           E_{s r} \\
     \end{bmatrix}=?\begin{bmatrix}
           E_{p i} \\
           E_{si} \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

Here the direction of $p_i$ and $p_{r}$ is different. That is because $\boldsymbol{k}_{i}=-\boldsymbol{k}_{r}$ and we set the base according to that. And from book, we know:

$$
     \begin{aligned}
         r_{p}&=\frac{E_{pr}}{E_{p i}}=\frac{n_1-n_2}{n_1+n_2}\\
          r_{s}&=\frac{E_{s r}}{E_{si}}=\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_2+n_1}
     \end{aligned}
$$

Therefore

$$
     \begin{bmatrix}
           E_{pr} \\
           E_{s r} \\
     \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
           r_pE_{p i} \\
           r_sE_{s i} \\
     \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
          r_p &  0 \\
          0 &  r_s \\
     \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
           E_{ p i} \\
           E_{si} \\
     \end{bmatrix}={\color{Red}r_p \begin{bmatrix}
          1 &  0 \\
          0 &  -1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}}\begin{bmatrix}
           E_{p i} \\
           E_{si} \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

So that we get **reflect matrix**:

$$
     \widetilde{R}=r_p \begin{bmatrix}
          1 &  0 \\
          0 &  -1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

This is the operator that represents reflection. And it is straightforward that if you input L-circular p-light, its output will be R-circular p-light. 

Now suppose you have an operator $\widetilde{O}$(today all $\widetilde{O}$s are 2x2 matrices). What do you mean that you know $\widetilde{O}$? That means you know all elements:

$$
     \widetilde{O}=\begin{pmatrix}
          o_{11} &  o_{12} \\
          o_{21} &  o_{22} \\
     \end{pmatrix}
$$

And then you will know how it operate on the vector. Then you can know **det** and **eigens**. 

But here is the problem: if we don't $\widetilde{O}$, how to find it?

#### Method 1. $\widetilde{O}$'s action on base vecs

A straightforward idea is let $\widetilde{O}$ act on base vecs $|1\rang,|2\rang$. If we know 

$$
\widetilde{O}|1\rang=|1'\rang\\
\widetilde{O}|2\rang=|2'\rang
$$

> REVIEW $\quad$ **linear algebra: linear maps and matrices**
> 
>……

Now we can know how it acts on all the vectors

$$
\widetilde{O}|E_{in}\rang=\widetilde{O}(a|1\rang+b|2\rang)=a \widetilde{O}|1\rang+b \widetilde{O}|2\rang=a|1'\rang+b|2'\rang
$$


Let's find $\widetilde{O}$' exp in its original $[|1\rang \quad|2\rang]$ base. Obvious it is :

$$
\widetilde{O}|1\rang=\widetilde{O}\begin{bmatrix}
      1 \\
      0 \\
\end{bmatrix}=O_{1}\\
\widetilde{O}|2\rang=\widetilde{O}\begin{bmatrix}
      0 \\
      1 \\
\end{bmatrix}=O_2\\
\widetilde{O}=\begin{bmatrix}
     O_1 &  O_2 \\
\end{bmatrix}=\widetilde{O}\begin{bmatrix}
     |1\rang &  |2\rang \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$


So $|j\rang$ will give $j_{th}$ Col of $\widetilde{O}$. That is because $\widetilde{O}$ is the expression in original $[|1\rang\quad |2\rang]$ base.

$\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 1}}$ $\widetilde{L}_{+45}$: linear polarizer; T along +45. In H-V base, find its exp.<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-30-18-58-50.png" style="zoom:35%;" />

$\color{green}{\bf{▶ S.}}$ easy to find:

$$
     \widetilde{L}_{+45}|H\rang=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|+45\rang\\
     \widetilde{L}_{+45}|V\rang=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|+45\rang
$$

Remember that<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-30-19-00-13.png" style="zoom:25%;" />

$$
     |+45\rang=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}\\
     |-45\rang=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           -1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

And you can get its two cols. Therefore, you can find the matrix:

$$
     \widetilde{L}_{+45}=\frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
          1 &  1 \\
          1 &  1 \\
     \end{pmatrix}
$$

The coefficient $\frac{1}{2}$ doesn't matter. It just guarantees that energy is conserved. What does matter is the matrix form. 

Have a test:

$$
\widetilde{L}_{+45}\begin{bmatrix}
      A \\
      Be^{i\phi} \\
\end{bmatrix}=\frac{1}{2}(A+Be^{i\phi})\begin{bmatrix}
      1 \\
      1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

It does linear polarized light.

Actually you can always decompose $|H\rang$ in $[|+45\rang\quad |-45\rang]$ base

$$
     |H\rang=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|+45\rang+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|-45\rang \\
     |V\rang=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|+45\rang-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|-45\rang
$$

Just do the dot product bet $|H\rang$, $|V\rang$ and $|+45\rang$, $|-45\rang$ base. And then do the same thing above(act with $\widetilde{O}$).

#### Method 2. Directly find element of $\widetilde{O}$

Define **elements**: $\widetilde{O}_{ij}$

And we will find:

$$
\widetilde{O}_{ij}=\lang i|\widetilde{O}|j\rang
$$

$\color{green}{\bf{▶ Pf.}}$ 

$$
     \lang i|\widetilde{O}|j\rang=\lang i|(\widetilde{O}|j\rang)=\lang i|\widetilde{O}_j=\widetilde{O}_{ij}
$$

$\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 2}}$  $\lang 2|\widetilde{L}_{+45}|1\rang$

$\color{green}{\bf{▶ S.}}$ 

$$
     \begin{aligned}
         \lang 2|\widetilde{L}_{+45}|1\rang&=\lang V|\widetilde{L}_{+45}|H\rang\\
         &=\lang V|(|+45\rang \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})\\
         &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\
         &=\frac{1}{2}
     \end{aligned}
$$

It is exactly this:

$$
     \widetilde{L}_{+45}=\begin{bmatrix}
          \frac{1}{2} &  \frac{1}{2} \\
          {\color{red}\frac{1}{2}} &  \frac{1}{2} \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

####  Method 3. Eigenvector

We all know that:

$$
     \widetilde{O}|e_i\rang=\lambda_i|e_i\rang
$$

Here we give a diff idea to calc $\widetilde{O}$: **knowing eigenvector $|e_i\rang$ and eigenvalue $\lambda_i$, how to construct the matrix $\widetilde{O}$?** 

<div class=note>
Projector: 投影算符
</div>

Here we introduct the projector to do that.

- $\boldsymbol{\alpha}.$ Dynad: $|i\rang\lang j|$, $|i\rang, |j\rang$ are base vecs.
$$
     |i\rang\lang j|=\begin{bmatrix}
          0 & \cdots &  & \cdots &   \\
          \vdots &  & \vdots &  &  \vdots \\
           & \cdots & 1_{i,j} & \cdots &   \\
          \vdots &  & \vdots &  &  \vdots \\
           & \cdots &  & \cdots &  0 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$
That is called **rank-1 matrix**. Its rank is 1. Only one point is 0, and that is the mark of coordinate.
And now we have a very simple way to exp our matrix: 
$$
     \begin{aligned}
              \widetilde{O}=\sum_{i,j}^{}\widetilde{O}_{ij}|i\rang \lang j|&=\begin{bmatrix}
          O_{11} & 0 &  0 \\
          \vdots &  &  \vdots \\
          0 & \cdots &  0 \\
     \end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}
          0 & O_{12} &  0 \\
          \vdots &  &  \vdots \\
          0 & \cdots &  0 \\
     \end{bmatrix}+\cdots\,\cdots\\
     &=O_{11}|1\rang\lang 1|+O_{12}|1\rang\lang 2|+\cdots
     \end{aligned}
$$
This is my matrix. Then, if $i=j$, we will get $projector$.

- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ projector: $|i\rang\lang j|=\widetilde{P}_{i}$
  Let's find its effect:<img align="right" src="4.偏振.assets\2021-05-30-21-10-22.png" style="zoom:40%;" />
  $$
     \begin{aligned}
         \widetilde{P}_{i}|E_{in}\rang&=|i\rang\lang i|E_{in}\rang=(E_{in})_{i}|i\rang
     \end{aligned}
  $$
  Where $\lang i|E_{in}\rang$ is dot product, and it gives $i_{th}$ element of $|E_{in}\rang$.
  Of course, we can use any normalized $|\beta\rang$ vector to do projector:
  $$
     \widetilde{P}_{\beta}=|\beta\rang\lang \beta|\\
     \widetilde{P}_{\beta}|E\rang=E_{\beta}|\beta\rang
  $$
  Here we introduct a concept: **complete base**, which means we have enough vectors to span the whole space. In linear algebra, that means you have n linear independent bases for an n-dimension space. Obviously, we can have this relation:
  $$
     \sum_{i=1}^{n}|i\rang\lang i|=I
  $$
  that is very important. If we know all the n base vectors, we can completely know the vector. 
  Actually the you can choose any complete base and it will satisfy the relation.

  That is the matrix product!

That is called diagonalization. For a diagonal matrix $\widetilde{O}_{\Lambda}$, you can always exp it into:
$$
\widetilde{O}=\sum_{i,j}^{}\widetilde{O}_{\Lambda ij}|e_i\rang\lang e_j|=\sum_{i}^{}\lambda_i|e_i\rang\lang e_i|=\sum_{i}^{}\lambda_i \widetilde{P}_{e_i}

That tells you, if you know eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you will know the whole matrix.

$\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 3}}$ Find the expression of **right circular polarizer ($\widetilde{R}$)**, which is defined:
- completely pass $|R\rang$
- completely block $|L\rang$

$\color{green}{\bf{▶ S.}}$ (**method 1**)
Easy to find the eigenvecs are $|R\rang$ and $|L\rang$. That is the definition:
$$
\widetilde{R}|R\rang=|R\rang\\
\widetilde{R}|L\rang=0 \tag{*}
$$

So we can get:
$$
     \widetilde{R}=\sum_{i}^{}\lambda_i|e_i\rang\lang e_i|=1|R\rang\lang R|+0|L\rang\lang L|
$$

For
$$
     |R\rang=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           e^{-i \frac{\pi}{2}} \\
     \end{bmatrix}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           -i \\
     \end{bmatrix}\\
     |L\rang=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           e^{+i \frac{\pi}{2}} \\
     \end{bmatrix}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           i \\
     \end{bmatrix}\tag{**}
$$
Never forget $\red{\lang R|=|R\rang^\dagger=(|R\rang^*)^{T}}$!! So $\lang R|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}1 &  i \\\end{bmatrix}$.

So that
$$
     \widetilde{R}=\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
          1 &  i \\
          -i &  1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

Test it: 
$$
\widetilde{R}\begin{bmatrix}
      A \\
      B \\
\end{bmatrix}=\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
     1 &  i \\
     -i &  1 \\
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
      A \\
      B \\
\end{bmatrix}=\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
      A+Bi \\
      -iA+B \\
\end{bmatrix}=\frac{1}{2}(A+Bi)\red{\begin{bmatrix}
      1 \\
      -i \\
\end{bmatrix}}
$$
Indeed R-circular polarized light.

(**method 2**)use Method 1 or Method 2 before.

We have known:
$$
\widetilde{R}|H\rang=\widetilde{R}_{1}\\
\widetilde{R}|V\rang=\widetilde{R}_{2}
$$

They gives columns of $\widetilde{R}$. So we should decompose $|H\rang$ and $|V\rang$ in $|R \rang$ and $|L\rang$ base:

$$
     \begin{aligned}
              |H\rang&=|L\rang\lang L|H\rang+|R\rang\lang R|H\rang\\
              &=|L\rang \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
                   1 &  -i \\
              \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
                    1 \\
                    0 \\
              \end{bmatrix}+|R\rang \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
                   1 &  i \\
              \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
                    1 \\
                    0 \\
              \end{bmatrix}\\
              &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|L\rang+|R\rang)\\
              |V\rang&=|L\rang\lang L|V\rang+|R\rang\lang R|V\rang\\
              &=\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}(-|L\rang+|R\rang)
     \end{aligned}
$$

And then we can get:
$$
     \widetilde{R}=\begin{bmatrix}
          \widetilde{R}|H\rang &  \widetilde{R}|V\rang \\
     \end{bmatrix}\overset{*}{=}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
          \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
                1 \\
                -i \\
          \end{bmatrix} \right)&  i \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
                1 \\
                -i \\
          \end{bmatrix}\right) \\
     \end{bmatrix}=\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
          1 &  i \\
          -i &  1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
$$

$\color{teal}{\bf{▶ Ex. 4}}$ find the expression of **Quarter waveplate ($\widetilde{Q},\frac{\lambda}{4}$-plate)**. Here we put fast axis at 45°(that means we are actually finding $\widetilde{Q}_{45}$).

$\color{green}{\bf{▶ S.}}$ Use **projector(eigenbase)** method to practise.

Firstly we should find its eigenvecs. We have decompose light into fast and slow light(or $e$ light and $o$ light). Here $|+45\rang$ is fast light and $|-45\rang$ is slow light. Easy to get:
<div class=note> 
Here we use fast-axis and slow-axis. It is more convenient than o and e(we don't need to know o and e).
</div>

$$
     \begin{aligned}
     \widetilde{Q}_{45}|+45\rang&=e^{i\phi_{\text{fast}}}|+45\rang\\
     \widetilde{Q}_{45}|-45\rang&=e^{i\phi_{\text{slow}}}|-45\rang=e^{i(\phi_{\text{fast}}+\frac{\pi}{2})}|-45\rang
     \end{aligned}
$$

Here we define $|-45\rang=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}1 \\-1 \\ \end{bmatrix}$. You can try $\begin{bmatrix}-1 \\1 \\\end{bmatrix}$ and get same result. Therefore:

$$
     \begin{aligned}
         \widetilde{Q}_{45}&=\sum_{i}^{}\lambda_i|e_i\rang\lang e_i|\\
         &=e^{i\phi_{f}}\cdot \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
               1 \\
               1 \\
         \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
              1 &  1 \\
         \end{bmatrix}+e^{i\phi_{s}}\cdot \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
               1 \\
               -1 \\
         \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
              1 &  -1 \\
         \end{bmatrix}\\ 
         &=\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
              e^{i\phi_{f}}+e^{i\phi_{s}} &  e^{i\phi_{f}}-e^{i\phi_{s}} \\
              e^{i\phi_{f}}-e^{i\phi_{s}} &  e^{i\phi_{f}}+e^{i\phi_{s}} \\
         \end{bmatrix}\\
         &=\frac{1}{2}e^{i\phi_{f}}\begin{bmatrix}
              1+i &  1-i \\
              1-i &  1+i \\
         \end{bmatrix}\\
         &\propto \begin{bmatrix}

              -i &  1 \\

     \end{aligned}
$$

And then, we will move into quantum physics and quantum mechanics.
